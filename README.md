A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:

Explanations of the technologies used.
    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    React
    Netlify
    weatherapi-com via rapidapi.com

Explanations of the approach taken.
    I wanted to do something that was "easy" that did not require a lot of files/folders to be functional. I went in order on the suggested list and the weather link seemed to be the most straight forward. (and some links did not offer free api keys anymore)

A link to your live site.
   https://radiant-daifuku-c1e938.netlify.app

Usage instructions, if relevant.
    Type at least 3 letters to populate almost any city, state or country worldwide. Will also work with airport codes.

Unsolved problems.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
